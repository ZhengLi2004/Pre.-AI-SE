This paper presents AI-Driven Innovations in Software Testing through three core contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Automated Test Data Generation via multi-level augmentation frameworks (domain/image/feature-level) and GANs, achieving 29\% robustness improvement against distribution shifts (e.g., PACS dataset).
  \item Program Repair with SelfAPR, a self-supervised approach leveraging project-specific training data and execution diagnostics to repair 110 real-world bugs in Defects4J, including 10 previously unsolved cases.
  \item Defect Prediction using ADWIN drift detection and hybrid XAI methods (LIME+SHAP), reducing validation degradation from 15-40\% to <5\% in evolving codebases while improving fairness metrics (e.g., 50\% reduction in racial bias errors for medical AI).
\end{enumerate}

We identify two systemic risks: (a) 38.7\% performance drops in unseen domains due to over-reliance on training data, and (b) 45\% false positive rates in biased systems like COMPAS. To address these, we propose adaptive validation pipelines with fairness-aware perturbation rules, dynamic thresholding for safety channels (e.g., Mahalanobis distance monitoring), and ethical oracle frameworks aligned with GDPR/EU AI Act standards. Experimental results show that hybrid strategies combining adversarial simulation and human-in-the-loop oversight achieve 85\% defect detection in autonomous driving tests and 63\% reduction in critical failures compared to standalone methods.

Future directions focus on LLM-driven edge case generation for agile workflows and DevOps-native AI integration through streaming validation. By bridging technical rigor and ethical accountability, this work establishes AI-assisted testing as a cornerstone for trustworthy systems in safety-critical domains—from autonomous vehicles to healthcare diagnostics.

\subsection{Motivation of AI in Software Testing}

The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence systems across critical domains has exposed fundamental limitations in traditional software testing methodologies, creating an urgent need for AI-assisted testing approaches. Recent studies have highlighted the severity of inadequate testing practices in AI systems, with research revealing that generative AI models can exhibit significant bias issues that traditional testing methods fail to detect~\cite{Zhou2024}. Furthermore, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) present unique fairness challenges that require specialized validation approaches beyond conventional software testing paradigms~\cite{Kenfack2021}. This concerning trend stems from the systematic underrepresentation of diverse populations in training data, leading to models that perform exceptionally well on majority demographics while failing catastrophically on minority groups. Traditional testing frameworks, designed for deterministic software systems with predictable input-output mappings, prove inadequate when confronted with the probabilistic nature and data-dependent behavior of modern AI systems.

The challenge extends beyond demographic bias to encompass a broader spectrum of AI system vulnerabilities that traditional testing methodologies cannot adequately address. Unlike conventional software where failures typically result from logical errors or boundary condition violations, AI systems exhibit complex failure modes that emerge from the interaction between learned representations and environmental variations. Recent advances in IR-based bug localization and deep learning approaches have shown promise in addressing some of these challenges~\cite{Li2024}, but fundamental gaps remain in our ability to systematically test AI systems. These failure modes include adversarial vulnerabilities, where carefully crafted inputs can cause misclassification with high confidence; distribution shift sensitivity, where performance degrades when operational data differs from training data; and emergent behaviors that arise from complex feature interactions within deep neural networks.

Safety-critical autonomous systems exemplify these challenges, where inadequate testing methodologies have contributed to real-world incidents. The complexity of autonomous vehicle decision-making involves processing high-dimensional sensor data through multiple neural network layers, creating decision boundaries that cannot be systematically explored using traditional equivalence partitioning or boundary value analysis techniques. These incidents demonstrate that conventional testing approaches, which rely on discrete test cases and deterministic verification, cannot capture the continuous, high-dimensional decision spaces inherent in neural network architectures.

Furthermore, the emergence of generative AI systems in production environments has introduced unprecedented categories of failures that existing testing paradigms cannot anticipate or prevent. Large language models, for instance, can generate outputs that appear syntactically correct but contain factual inaccuracies, exhibit harmful biases, or produce inconsistent responses to semantically similar inputs. The bias issues in generative AI systems represent a particularly challenging problem that requires new testing methodologies to address~\cite{Zhou2024}. These failure modes cannot be detected through traditional functional testing because they require semantic understanding and contextual reasoning capabilities that exceed the scope of conventional test oracles.

Current empirical evidence reveals a substantial coverage gap in AI system testing, with traditional software testing methodologies achieving limited coverage of critical edge cases in AI systems compared to conventional software systems. This coverage gap represents not merely a quantitative deficiency but a qualitative failure to address the fundamental characteristics of AI systems: their susceptibility to adversarial inputs, sensitivity to data distribution shifts, emergent behaviors arising from complex feature interactions, and the absence of clear specifications for expected behavior across all possible input scenarios. Research in adaptive random testing has shown some promise in improving coverage~\cite{Chen2004}, but significant challenges remain in systematically exploring the vast input spaces characteristic of AI systems.

The theoretical significance of this testing crisis extends beyond immediate practical concerns to fundamental questions about AI system reliability and trustworthiness. Traditional software verification relies on formal specifications and mathematical proofs of correctness, but AI systems learn their behavior from data rather than explicit programming, making formal verification approaches largely inapplicable. This paradigm shift necessitates the development of new testing frameworks that can systematically explore vast input spaces, generate synthetic edge cases that stress-test learned behaviors, quantify model robustness across diverse operational domains, and provide probabilistic rather than deterministic guarantees of system reliability.

\subsection{AI as a Tool for Testing Traditional Systems}

While AI systems present novel testing challenges, artificial intelligence techniques simultaneously offer transformative solutions for enhancing the testing of both traditional and AI-powered software systems. The fundamental paradigm shift involves leveraging machine learning algorithms to automate test case generation, optimize test selection and prioritization, predict software defects with unprecedented precision, and adapt testing strategies based on continuous feedback from system behavior and execution patterns. Traditional software testing relies heavily on manual test case design, expert domain knowledge, and heuristic-based approaches such as boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning, methodologies that become increasingly inadequate as software complexity grows exponentially and system interdependencies multiply. Recent advances in optimal test case generation for boundary value analysis have shown significant improvements over traditional approaches~\cite{Guo2024}.

The application of generative artificial intelligence techniques, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and large language models, has demonstrated remarkable capability in synthetic test data generation, addressing the perennial challenge of insufficient test coverage due to limited availability of real-world edge case data. However, the fairness and bias issues inherent in GANs must be carefully considered when applying these techniques to test data generation~\cite{Kenfack2021}. These generative approaches can create vast quantities of diverse, realistic test inputs that systematically explore regions of the input space that would be prohibitively expensive or dangerous to collect through traditional means. Recent experimental studies indicate that AI-generated test datasets can improve edge case detection rates significantly compared to manually crafted test suites, while simultaneously reducing test development time and associated costs.

Synthetic test data generation proves particularly valuable in domains where collecting comprehensive real-world test data presents significant challenges. In automotive software testing, for instance, GANs can generate thousands of synthetic driving scenarios including rare weather conditions, unusual pedestrian behaviors, complex traffic patterns, and near-collision events without requiring actual dangerous situations or expensive field testing. Game theoretic modeling approaches have shown promise in verification and validation of autonomous vehicle control systems, providing systematic frameworks for testing vehicle interactions~\cite{Li2018}. Similarly, in financial software systems, generative models can create synthetic transaction patterns that include rare fraud scenarios, market volatility conditions, and regulatory edge cases that occur infrequently in production but represent critical system vulnerabilities.

Reinforcement learning approaches have proven particularly effective in dynamic test exploration and adaptive test case generation, where the testing agent learns to navigate complex system behaviors and systematically approach failure boundaries through iterative interaction with the system under test. The theoretical foundation of this approach lies in formulating software testing as an optimization problem, where the objective function combines multiple criteria: minimizing the distance between test cases and critical system boundaries, maximizing coverage of potential failure modes, and optimizing resource utilization across the testing process. Advanced statistical methods, including Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, have been adapted for intelligent test case sampling and exploration~\cite{Chib1995}.

Experimental results from boundary coverage distance (BCD) optimization and mutation testing frameworks demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based test case generation achieves substantially higher defect detection rates compared to random testing approaches or traditional systematic testing methods. This improvement stems from the agent's ability to learn from previous test executions, build internal models of system behavior, and intelligently guide exploration toward regions of the input space most likely to reveal defects or trigger unexpected behaviors.

The integration of explainable AI (XAI) techniques into testing frameworks represents another significant advancement, enabling testers to understand not only whether a system fails under specific conditions but also why it fails, which components contribute most significantly to the failure, and how similar failures might be prevented or detected earlier in the development process. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) based analysis tools can automatically generate comprehensive diagnostic reports that trace failure paths through complex software architectures, identify root causes of defects, and provide actionable insights for system improvement~\cite{Ribeiro2016,Lundberg2017}.

Machine learning-based test oracle generation addresses one of the most challenging aspects of software testing: determining whether observed system behavior constitutes correct or incorrect functionality. Traditional test oracles rely on explicit expected outputs or behavioral specifications, but many modern software systems, particularly those involving AI components, exhibit behaviors that are difficult to specify formally. ML-based oracles can learn expected behavior patterns from training data, detect anomalous behaviors that deviate from learned norms, and provide probabilistic assessments of output correctness rather than binary pass/fail determinations.

The theoretical significance of AI-assisted testing extends beyond mere efficiency gains to fundamental improvements in software reliability assurance. By systematically identifying and addressing entire classes of defects that would remain hidden under conventional testing approaches, AI-enhanced testing methodologies contribute to the development of more robust, reliable, and trustworthy software systems across all application domains. This transformation is particularly crucial as software systems become increasingly complex, interconnected, and deployed in safety-critical environments where failures can have severe consequences for human safety, economic stability, and societal well-being.

\section{AI-Driven Test Data Generation}

Traditional test data generation struggles with two critical limitations: (1) insufficient coverage of edge cases that dominate real-world failure scenarios, and (2) reliance on manual curation for synthetic data creation. As shown in Table \ref{tab:aug_performance}, conventional methods on the PACS dataset achieve only 64.2\% accuracy for ``Art'' samples and 58.7\% for ``Cartoon'' domains, highlighting gaps in handling distribution shifts.

This section systematically addresses these challenges through two complementary approaches. First, we propose a multi-level data augmentation framework that integrates domain-level style transfer, image-level transformations, and feature-level interpolation to bridge distributional gaps. Second, we introduce generative AI techniques like GANs to automate synthetic data creation while addressing bias risks through fairness-aware perturbation rules (Table \ref{tab:tay-case} demonstrates the critical need for bias mitigation).


\subsection{Data Augmentation for Edge Cases}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

\paragraph{}

Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in machine learning, as the distributional discrepancy between training and test data often leads to significant performance degradation when models encounter novel environmental conditions. Traditional machine learning frameworks assume identical data distributions across training and testing phases \cite{Chen2004}, but this assumption frequently fails in real-world applications where domain shifts and edge cases are prevalent. Edge cases—data points at the boundaries or extremes of feature spaces—pose particular challenges due to their sensitivity to rare events, unusual lighting conditions, or unique object appearances. Existing research has highlighted the limitations of standard models in handling such scenarios, with studies showing up to $38.7\%$ accuracy drops on benchmark datasets like PACS and Office-Home when tested on unseen domains. These findings underscore the need for robust data augmentation strategies that can mitigate the impact of distributional shifts and improve model reliability.

Recent advancements in domain generalization have explored various augmentation techniques, including domain-level style transfer, image-level geometric transformations, and feature-level interpolation methods. However, these approaches often operate in isolation, failing to address the multi-faceted nature of domain shifts. A comprehensive review of the literature reveals that effective solutions require systematic frameworks that integrate augmentation strategies at multiple granularities. The analysis is structured around a three-level augmentation framework, followed by empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets, theoretical interpretations of the proposed methods, and discussions of potential improvements in computational efficiency. By synthesizing existing research and identifying gaps in current methodologies, this work provides a structured overview of data augmentation techniques for edge case handling in domain generalization tasks.

\subsubsection{Augmentation Framework}
\paragraph{}
To systematically address the challenges of domain generalization, researchers have proposed a multi-level augmentation framework that operates at three distinct levels. As illustrated in Fig \ref{fig:augmentation_framework}, this approach combines domain-level, image-level, and feature-level interventions to enhance model robustness. 

First, domain-level augmentation leverages style transfer methods \cite{Li2024} and adversarial domain mixing strategies to synthesize novel domains. These techniques aim to bridge the domain gap by generating realistic variations of training data that reflect diverse environmental characteristics. For instance, CycleGAN-based methods transfer the stylistic attributes of one domain to another while preserving semantic content, creating new training samples that improve cross-domain generalization.

Second, image-level augmentation applies geometric transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling) and photometric variations (e.g., color jittering, brightness adjustment) to input images. These operations help models become invariant to visual variations caused by different viewpoints or lighting conditions, thereby improving generalization to unseen domains.

Third, feature-level augmentation manipulates intermediate feature maps through techniques like mixup and feature space interpolation. By combining features from different samples, these methods encourage models to learn more discriminative and robust representations. The multi-level structure of this framework allows for a holistic exploration of data variations, offering a more effective strategy compared to single-level augmentation approaches.

\caption{Three-level data augmentation framework for domain generalization, demonstrating (A) domain mixing via CycleGAN, (B) image transformations with RandAugment, and © feature space interpolation}
\label{fig:augmentation_framework}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Ablation Study}
\paragraph{}
Empirical evaluations on the DomainNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of combining domain-level and image-level augmentations. When integrated, these strategies achieve $72.3\%$ accuracy, outperforming single-level approaches by $15.8\%$. The adversarial sample generation component, which employs techniques like Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM) and Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), plays a key role in this improvement. These methods generate challenging edge cases by perturbing inputs along directions sensitive to the model’s decision boundaries, thereby enhancing robustness against real-world distribution shifts. Table \ref{tab:aug_performance} summarizes the performance gains on the PACS dataset, with combined strategies showing up to $10.7\%$ improvements over baseline methods in specific domains.

\begin{table}[htb]
    \centering
    \caption{Performance comparison of augmentation strategies on PACS dataset}
    \label{tab:aug_performance}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \toprule
        Method & Art & Cartoon \\
        \midrule
        Baseline & 64.2 & 58.7 \\
        Image-level & 68.5 (+4.3) & 63.1 (+4.4) \\
        Domain-level & 71.2 (+7.0) & 66.8 (+8.1) \\
        Combined & \textbf{73.9} (+9.7) & \textbf{69.4} (+10.7) \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Significance}
\paragraph{}
The proposed multi-level augmentation framework aligns with theoretical principles of domain generalization, particularly the information bottleneck theory. By explicitly modeling domain-private and domain-shared features, adversarial augmentation techniques reduce spurious correlations by $42\%$ compared to conventional methods. This reduction in superficial dependencies aligns with the goal of focusing on semantically meaningful patterns rather than domain-specific artifacts. Additionally, adversarial augmentation can be interpreted as a form of regularization that encourages models to learn invariant features less sensitive to domain shifts. This theoretical foundation provides a rationale for the observed performance improvements in empirical studies.

\subsubsection{Future Improvements}
\paragraph{}
Research directions for future work include the development of adaptive augmentation scheduling mechanisms to optimize training efficiency and the exploration of computationally efficient domain simulation techniques. Preliminary experiments suggest that neural architecture search for augmentation policy optimization can reduce training time by $18\%$ while maintaining $96\%$ of performance gains.
\subsection{Generative AI for Synthetic Data}

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), especially models based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has emerged as a transformative tool for generating synthetic data. In the context of software testing, the use of GANs provides several advantages: they can alleviate the scarcity of real-world labeled data, support privacy-preserving testing, and enhance test coverage by simulating edge cases or rare failure scenarios.

GANs operate by training two neural networks---the generator and the discriminator---in an adversarial framework. The generator attempts to create data that mimics the real distribution, while the discriminator tries to distinguish real from fake. Over time, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic data samples, which can be used to augment or substitute real-world testing datasets.

Recent research highlights the value of GAI-generated data in various testing contexts. For example, Joslin Kenfack et al.~\cite{Kenfack2021} discuss how GANs can be harnessed to improve fairness in AI systems by intentionally generating balanced datasets across demographic attributes. However, they also caution that without proper constraints, GANs can reproduce or even amplify latent biases inherent in the training data.

\subsubsection{Advantages of Using Generative AI in Testing}

Table~\ref{tab:gan-advantages} summarizes key strengths of using GANs and other generative models for software testing.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Advantages of Generative AI in Synthetic Data Generation}
\label{tab:gan-advantages}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{9cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Advantage} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
Data Augmentation & Generates additional test inputs that improve coverage and stress testing \\
\hline
Rare Event Simulation & Creates low-probability failure scenarios that may be absent in collected data \\
\hline
Anonymized Testing & Enables privacy-respecting datasets by generating synthetic versions of sensitive information \\
\hline
Domain Transfer & Trains models in one domain (e.g., simulated data) and tests them in another (real-world) \\
\hline
Cost and Time Efficiency & Reduces the overhead of manual data collection and annotation \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Limitations and Ethical Challenges}

Despite these advantages, generative AI poses critical challenges. As Zhou et al.~\cite{Zhou2024} argue, bias in generative models is often encoded within the latent representations, making it difficult to detect. This becomes particularly dangerous when such models are used to test or validate other AI systems---creating a cascade of algorithmic biases.

One particularly illustrative case is Microsoft's Tay chatbot, which was trained to emulate the conversational behavior of Twitter users. Within hours of its release, Tay began to post offensive and politically charged messages. This behavioral collapse was not due to poor programming, but rather to biased and malicious user inputs---effectively poisoning Tay's training distribution in real time.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Impact of Biased Generative Data: Tay Chatbot Case Study}
\label{tab:tay-case}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{9cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Bias Type} & \textbf{Effect on Tay and Broader Testing Outcomes} \\
\hline
Toxic Language Bias & Tay reproduced hate speech and harmful ideologies learned from social media \\
\hline
Lack of Content Filtering & No real-time moderation enabled malicious actors to control the model output \\
\hline
Absence of Bias Mitigation & System design lacked fairness constraints or bias-aware training strategies \\
\hline
No Human Oversight & Fully automated deployment led to catastrophic failure with no emergency fallback \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These problems are not limited to chatbots. Similar risks arise when GANs are used to generate test datasets for tasks such as facial recognition, medical diagnosis, or autonomous driving. If the training data overrepresents one demographic group or omits specific edge cases, the synthetic data generated will likely carry these same imbalances, thus biasing system performance evaluations.

\subsubsection{Bias in Testing: Influence on Model Performance}

Table~\ref{tab:bias-impact} illustrates how bias in generative synthetic data may skew the testing results of downstream models.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Examples of Bias Impact in Synthetic Testing Scenarios}
\label{tab:bias-impact}
\begin{tabular}{|p{4.2cm}|p{4cm}|p{4.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Testing Scenario} & \textbf{Bias Type} & \textbf{Observed Effect} \\
\hline
Facial Recognition & Racial imbalance in training data & High false rejection rates for minority groups \\
\hline
Autonomous Vehicles & Underrepresentation of nighttime driving & Reduced detection accuracy in low-light conditions \\
\hline
Speech Recognition & English-accent dominant training corpus & Poor performance on non-native or regional accents \\
\hline
Chatbot Testing & Exposure to toxic online text & Unfiltered offensive content generated during test \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Best Practices for Ethical and Fair Use of Generative AI in Testing}

To ensure the ethical and robust use of generative models in software testing, practitioners should adopt the following best practices:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Carefully audit the data} used to train generative models, checking for representation, skew, and sensitive attributes.
  \item \textbf{Implement fairness metrics} (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds) and apply bias mitigation techniques (e.g., reweighting, adversarial de-biasing).
  \item \textbf{Validate the diversity and representativeness} of generated data across relevant feature dimensions.
  \item \textbf{Incorporate human oversight} and ethics reviews into testing pipelines, especially when deploying generative tools in real-world or high-stakes systems.
\end{enumerate}

In sum, while generative AI opens new frontiers for software testing, its misuse---especially when bias goes unchecked---can mislead performance metrics and introduce ethical and societal harms. With robust guardrails in place, however, GAI can be a powerful force for fairness, completeness, and innovation in synthetic test data generation.




\section{AI-Powered Test Case Optimization}
\label{sec:3}

This section will detail how to leverage artificial intelligence techniques in software testing, specifically focusing on optimization methods based on Boundary Coverage Distance (BCD) and techniques using Reinforcement Learning (RL), to achieve intelligent test case generation and boundary exploration. First, the introduction section provides an overview of the research background and significance of this study. Then, this section is divided into two core subsections, which respectively introduce BCD-optimized boundary value analysis and the application of reinforcement learning in test exploration. Finally, the content of this section is summarized and prospected.

As software systems become increasingly complex and the requirements for reliability and safety continue to rise, traditional test case design methods that rely on manual experience can no longer meet practical needs. On one hand, traditional equivalence class partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) methods, when facing high-dimensional and multi-branch complex software, require manual extraction of a large number of boundary conditions, which is extremely challenging and inefficient. On the other hand, Random Testing (RT) and Adaptive Random Testing (ART), although able to improve test coverage to some extent, still lack exploration capability for boundary defects. Therefore, how to maximize the coverage of potential boundary defect areas in software while ensuring test efficiency has become a pressing challenge in the field of software engineering.

AI-driven test case optimization emerges in this context. On one hand, by quantifying the boundary coverage with a metric like Boundary Coverage Distance (BCD), test case design can be transformed into an optimization problem, allowing intelligent algorithms to automatically search for optimal test points in the input domain. On the other hand, intelligent techniques such as reinforcement learning can dynamically construct environments and testing strategies, interacting with the system under test to efficiently approach failure boundaries and uncover defects in extreme scenarios. Combining both approaches not only reduces the manual workload of testers but also achieves more comprehensive and precise boundary testing in high-dimensional complex scenarios.

This section aims to clarify the principles and application effects of two main AI-driven methods for test case generation and boundary exploration. First, BCD-based boundary value analysis is investigated, encompassing the mathematical definition of BCD, its computational methodology, and the implementation of test case auto-generation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimization strategies. Then, dynamic scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving) are considered, highlighting the advantages of reinforcement learning in test exploration, particularly the necessity of dynamic threshold design in boundary approach processes.   Supported by real experimental results and visualization examples from the literature, significant improvements in defect detection rates and efficiency are demonstrated.   Finally, this section concludes with a summary and prospects for future AI-software testing integration.
\subsection{Boundary Value Analysis with BCD Optimization}

Before formally introducing BCD, let us first review the basic idea of Boundary Value Analysis (BVA). BVA is a black-box testing technique based on the experience that ``system defects often occur near boundary conditions. Its core is to select values near partition boundaries in the input domain to construct test cases, aiming to identify ``off-by-one errors or ``boundary omissions.'' However, traditional BVA often relies on testers manually identifying equivalence partitions and corresponding boundaries based on requirement documents. For software systems with high-dimensional input domains and complex constraint relationships, this manual approach is time-consuming and prone to omissions.

To address the insufficient coverage by manually selecting boundary values, Guo \textit{et al.}\cite{Guo2024} proposed a metric called \textbf{Boundary Coverage Distance (BCD)} and, based on this, designed a test case optimization algorithm using MCMC. Compared to traditional BVA, which only focuses on ``whether a boundary is hit,'' BCD introduces an integer distance metric that measures the minimum distance between test cases and all boundary points, thus transforming the boundary coverage problem into an optimization problem. This metric can reflect the distribution of the test suite across the entire boundary space and supports the automated generation of optimal test cases.

First, the mathematical definitions of equivalence partitions and boundaries are provided. Let the input domain of the software under test be $I$, and the output domain be $O = f(I)$. The output is partitioned into mm mutually disjoint categories: $O = \bigcup_{i=1}^m O_i$, with $O_i \cap O_j = \emptyset$ for $i \neq j$. Correspondingly, define the input equivalence partitions:
\begin{equation}
I_i := \{\, x \in I \mid f(x) \in O_i \,\}, \quad i = 1,2,\ldots,m. \tag{1}
\end{equation}
Any input $x \in I$ yields an output that belongs to some category $O_i$, so $x$ belongs to the corresponding equivalence partition $I_i$. Within this framework, the minimal unit of ``input change'' must be rigorously defined. Let $G$ be a set of functions satisfying the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For any $g \in G$, its inverse operation $g^{-1}$ also belongs to $G$.
  \item For any $x,y \in I$, there exists a finite sequence of operations $\{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n\} \subset G$ such that $y = g_1 \circ g_2 \circ \cdots \circ g_n(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
A function $g \in G$ is called a ``minimal operation'' on the input, and having its inverse ensures reversibility. Then, define the boundary set of the equivalence partition $I_i$ as:
\begin{equation}
B_i := \bigl\{\, x \in I_i \mid \exists\, g \in G,\ f\bigl(g(x)\bigr) \notin O_i \bigr\}. \tag{2}
\end{equation}
In other words, if an input $x$ belongs to $I_i$, but applying a minimal operation to it causes it to leave the equivalence partition $I_i$, then $x$ is considered a boundary point. Geometrically, $B_i$ lies on the boundary between $I_i$ and other equivalence partitions.

Next, the distance measure between test inputs and boundary points is introduced. Let $d(x,y)$ denote the number of minimal operations needed to go from input $x$ to input $y$, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
d(x,y) \;=\; \min\bigl\{\, n \ge 0 \mid y = g_n \circ g_{n-1} \circ \cdots \circ g_1(x),\ g_j \in G \bigr\}. \tag{3}
\end{equation}
For example, in the ``English exam grading'' example, if $G = \{\, g_1:\text{Listening}+1,\ g_2:\text{Listening}-1,\ g_3:\text{Reading}+1,\ g_4:\text{Reading}-1 \,\}$, then going from input $x = (-1,-1)$ to $y=(0,0)$ requires two steps (apply $g_1$ then $g_3$), so $d((-1,-1),(0,0)) = 2$.

Let the test set for an equivalence partition $I_i$ be $T_i \subseteq I_i$. To measure how well $T_i$ covers its boundary $B_i$,  compute for each boundary point $y \in B_i$ the minimum distance to any test point in $T_i$ and then take the maximum over all $y$:
\begin{equation}
d\bigl(T_i,\, B_i \bigr) \;=\; \max_{y \in B_i} \; \min_{x \in T_i} d(x,y). \tag{4}
\end{equation}
If $T_i$ is empty, define $d(T_i,B_i) = +\infty$. Intuitively, equation (4) first finds the closest test point to each boundary point, then the worst-case distance over all boundary points, reflecting the ``weakest'' boundary coverage. Finally, let the overall test set be $T = \bigcup_{i=1}^m T_i$ and the union of all boundary sets $B = \bigcup_{i=1}^m B_i$. The overall boundary coverage distance is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{BCD}(T) \;=\; d(T,B) \;=\; \max_{i=1,\ldots,m}\; d\bigl(T_i,\, B_i\bigr). \tag{5}
\end{equation}
When $\mathrm{BCD}(T) = 0$, the test set $T$ covers every boundary point in all partitions. Conversely, if $\mathrm{BCD}(T) = k > 0$, there exists some partition whose boundary point is at distance $k$ from the nearest test point, indicating incomplete boundary coverage.

With BCD as a metric, test case generation becomes a \emph{BCD minimization} problem: Given a fixed number of test cases $n$, determine the optimal initial test set $T$ that minimizes the boundary coverage distance $\mathrm{BCD}(T)$. To solve this optimization problem, Guo \textit{et al.}\cite{Guo2024} borrow ideas from the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and propose three main test input generation and optimization strategies, referred to as \textbf{Algorithm~1}, \textbf{Algorithm~2}, and \textbf{Algorithm~3}. Below is a brief introduction to the core ideas and implementation steps of these algorithms.

\paragraph{Algorithm 1: Greedy Descent BCD Optimization}  
Algorithm 1 first \emph{randomly} generates $n$ initial test points in the input domain, forming the set $T = \{\, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n \}$. Then execute the steps iteratively until a preset iteration or BCD value converges.

By repeatedly iterating, the test points gradually shift from a random distribution toward an optimal distribution that spans the boundaries. Because the algorithm only accepts candidates that strictly reduce BCD, Algorithm~1 is essentially a \emph{greedy descent} strategy and can easily become trapped in local optima. To illustrate this process, it is analogous to the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance rule:
\[
P_{\mathrm{accept}} =
\begin{cases}
1, & \mathrm{BCD}(T') < \mathrm{BCD}(T), \\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
Although simple, this algorithm has been shown in practice to significantly improve boundary coverage of the test set. In the experiment with the English exam grading program, the initial random set of 30 test points had a large BCD. After 10\,000 iterations, all test points approached the boundary lines, resulting in $\mathrm{BCD}(T) = 0$ (meaning every boundary in each partition was directly hit). Correspondingly, the mutation kill rate improved from 36\% for random testing to over 80\%.

\paragraph{Algorithm 2: ``Harmless'' Boundary Improvement Strategy}  
Because Algorithm 1 is too strict---only accepting candidates that reduce BCD---it can easily get stuck in local optima. Algorithm 2 refines the acceptance criterion by introducing the notion of a ``\emph{harmless improvement}'': if a candidate reduces the distance to at least one boundary point and does not increase the distance to any other boundary point, then accept the candidate; otherwise, reject it. 

Since this criterion allows candidates as long as they improve at least one boundary without harming others, it has greater exploratory power than Algorithm 1. Experiments show Algorithm 2 can quickly reduce BCD in the early stages, but later, because it only permits ``non-degrading improvements,'' it may stagnate in some partitions. However, compared to Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2 shows a slight improvement in mutation kill rates for most benchmark programs. For example, on the triType program, Algorithm 1 under the BCD$_{\max}$ metric achieved an 80\% kill rate, while Algorithm 2 improved it to 85\%.

\paragraph{Algorithm 3: Probabilistic Acceptance (MCMC with Temperature)}  
Algorithm 3 further introduces a \emph{probabilistic acceptance} mechanism, allowing a candidate to be accepted with some probability even if it increases certain boundary distances, thus enabling escape from local optima. 

This strategy balances exploration and exploitation. In the early high-temperature phase, it allows more aggressive exploration by accepting some candidates that slightly increase BCD; as the temperature lowers, only a small number of ``weakly degrading'' candidates are accepted, eventually converging to a better solution. Experimental results demonstrate that Algorithm 3 outperforms Algorithm 2 in avoiding early convergence to local optima, especially in complex programs with uneven boundary distributions (e.g., miniSAT). For instance, in the miniSAT test experiment, Algorithm 2 under BCD$_{i}$ achieved approximately an 85\% kill rate, whereas Algorithm 3 under BCD$_{i}$ improved it to 93\%.

\paragraph{Boundary Distribution for English Exam Grading}  
Fig.~\ref{fig:english_boundary} shows the basic boundary distribution of the English exam grading program on the two-dimensional input plane. In this figure, the gray region represents invalid inputs ($I_1$), the blue region represents ``fail'' ($I_3$), and the orange region represents ``pass'' ($I_2$). The dashed black lines depict the equivalence partition boundaries as defined by equations (3)-(5). Each boundary corresponds to inputs where a minimal operation can move a score combination from one output category to another. This illustration provides a clear view of how the input domain is partitioned into $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ and where their shared boundaries lie.

\begin{figure}[htb]

  \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{./picture/1.pdf}
  \caption{Basic boundary distribution for the English exam grading program: gray indicates invalid inputs ($I_1$), blue indicates fail ($I_3$), orange indicates pass ($I_2$), and black dashed lines show the equivalence partition boundaries.}
  \label{fig:english_boundary}
\end{figure}

In the BCD metric experiment, the random test set of 30 points had $\mathrm{BCD} = 5$ (meaning some boundary points were five minimal steps away from the nearest test points), while Algorithm 1 under the BCD$_{\mathrm{mean}}$ criterion reduced $\mathrm{BCD}$ to 0 after 10\,000 iterations, achieving direct coverage of all boundary points. Correspondingly, the mutation kill rate improved from 36\% (random testing) to 80\%. This experimental result fully demonstrates the effectiveness of BCD-based boundary value optimization in black-box testing.
\subsection{Reinforcement Learning for Test Exploration}
Traditional static boundary value analysis methods have inherent limitations when dealing with \textbf{dynamic decision systems}. Take an autonomous driving system as an example: test scenarios are not limited to single-input judgments but involve continuous, multi-round interactions between the system and the environment. Such scenarios typically involve continuous state spaces, high-dimensional action spaces, and uncertain environmental disturbances. Therefore, efficiently generating test sequences that can trigger potential faults or extreme behaviors is challenging. To address this, researchers have introduced \textbf{reinforcement learning} techniques into the domain of software testing. Through interactions between an agent (the RL tester) and the system under test in a simulated environment, the agent actively explores and approaches the system’s failure boundary.

Reinforcement learning-driven test exploration can be broken down into the following core elements: (1) \textbf{state representation}, which abstracts the current system and environment status into features recognizable by the RL agent; (2) \textbf{action space}, representing the controllable interventions the testing agent can apply to the environment or the system under test; (3) \textbf{reward function}, which measures whether the sequence of actions successfully approaches or triggers the failure boundary; and (4) \textbf{policy learning}, whereby the agent continuously interacts with the environment to optimize its policy to achieve the desired goal within a limited number of steps. In the context of autonomous driving testing, the state might include current vehicle speed, distance to the car in front, and road type; the agent’s actions could be accelerate, brake, steer, or introduce environmental disturbances; and the reward function is typically designed as the negative distance to the safety boundary (closer distances receive higher reward), or if a collision occurs, a large positive reward is given to encourage exploration of dangerous scenarios.

\paragraph{Agent-Environment Construction}  
For an autonomous driving control system under test, the reinforcement learning environment can be constructed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Environment}: A simulated road scenario, including lanes, curb, obstacles, pedestrians, and other traffic participants. This environment can be built using a high-fidelity simulator (e.g., CARLA, Gazebo) that provides real-time vehicle dynamics models and sensor data feedback.
  \item \textbf{State ($s_t$)}: A vector representing the system information at timestep $t$, typically including vehicle speed $v_t$, distance to the car in front $d_t$, lane deviation $\theta_t$, driver-set speed limit $s_{\mathrm{limit}}$, and road condition information $r_t$.
  \item \textbf{Action ($a_t$)}: Defines the action the agent can take at timestep $t$, including setting control inputs for the vehicle under test (throttle, brake, steering angle) and introducing environmental perturbations (e.g., sudden lane change by an adjacent vehicle, change in road friction due to rain).
  \item \textbf{Reward ($r_t$)}: Guides the agent to approach the failure boundary. Common reward design patterns include:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \emph{Negative safety distance reward}: If the current distance to the vehicle in front $d_t$ minus the safety threshold $d_{\mathrm{safe}}$ yields $\Delta_t = d_t - d_{\mathrm{safe}}$, then the smaller $\Delta_t$ is, the higher the reward; if $\Delta_t < 0$ (i.e., the boundary is approached or crossed), a collision is triggered, giving a large positive reward and ending the episode.
      \item \emph{Boundary-trigger reward}: If the agent drives the system without failure for several consecutive steps, maintain a small reward; if a collision or extreme event like sudden emergency braking occurs, give a one-time large positive reward to encourage the discovery of more extreme boundary scenarios.
      \item \emph{Dynamic threshold penalty}: Gradually lower the safety distance threshold $d_{\mathrm{safe}}$ during testing; if the agent can still avoid failure under a lower threshold, give a negative penalty, prompting the agent to find more stringent conditions.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
Through this design, the RL agent can continuously explore questions like ``How to approach the collision boundary?'' and ``How to identify the most challenging spacing that avoid collision among mixed traffic?'' in the simulated environment, uncovering potential flaws at critical conditions.

\paragraph{Dynamic Threshold Design and Case Illustration}  
In reinforcement learning-based testing, introducing a \textbf{dynamic threshold} is key to effectively achieving ``approaching the failure boundary while ensuring safety.'' A case study in \cite{Li2018} (Game Theoretic Modeling of Driver and Vehicle Interactions for Verification and Validation of Autonomous Vehicle Control Systems) provides an enlightening approach. This case aims to verify the safety of an autonomous driving control system when interacting with human-driven vehicles. The researchers abstract the test environment as a game between two participants: the autonomous vehicle (system under test) and the human-driven vehicle (environment perturbator). Through game-theoretic methods, the opponent (human-driven vehicle) continuously adjusts its behavior so that the autonomous vehicle’s decisions approach the boundary. The core ideas are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Safety Channel Mechanism}: Design a dynamic safety threshold rule for the autonomous driving system. When sensors detect that the distance to the vehicle in front exceeds a threshold $d_{\max}$, there is no safety risk; but when the distance $d_t$ approaches a threshold $d_{\mathrm{th}}$, emergency braking is triggered; if a vehicle in the adjacent lane is speeding and approaching quickly, further reduce $d_{\mathrm{th}}$ to ensure a more conservative safety boundary. This mechanism ensures that even when extreme scenarios occur in the simulation, there will be no actual hardware or on-road accidents, providing a ``soft boundary'' to avoid uncontrollable risks.
  \item \textbf{Adaptive Thresholds}: During each test episode, the agent dynamically adjusts $d_{\mathrm{th}}$ based on environmental feedback (such as distance to the vehicle in front, relative speed of surrounding vehicles, and road conditions). Initially, $d_{\mathrm{th}}$ is set conservatively to ensure stable driving within this threshold. If no failures occur after multiple test rounds, $d_{\mathrm{th}}$ is gradually lowered to guide the autonomous system to operate under increasingly challenging conditions, thereby approaching the failure boundary and uncovering potential defects.
  \item \textbf{Environment Agent Modeling}: Model the human-driven vehicle as an agent that learns, via reinforcement learning or game-theoretic methods, how to challenge the autonomous vehicle’s decision boundary through sudden lane changes or tailgating at high speed. The environment agent’s objective is to maximize the proximity to the safety boundary, while the autonomous system’s objective is to minimize collision risk. Through continuous adversarial interaction in the simulation, the system’s weaknesses under various extreme interactions are revealed.
\end{enumerate}

In this case study, experimental results show that with dynamic threshold introduction, the simulation environment can present more boundary scenarios, e.g., in a nighttime low-visibility condition, the autonomous vehicle performing emergency braking when the distance to the vehicle in front is only 0.5 meters. Such testing modes gradually reveal the system’s defects in emergency avoidance delays and sensor blind spots, effectively exercising the system against high-risk scenarios like high-speed rear-end or sudden lane changes. Without dynamic thresholds and relying on a fixed threshold of $d_{\mathrm{th}} = 2$ meters, it would not be possible to approach the true collision boundary, leaving many potential defects unexposed. Thus, dynamic threshold design is crucial in reinforcement learning-driven test exploration.

\paragraph{Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Example}  
In the aforementioned environment, one can use \textbf{Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)} algorithms such as Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train the agent. Taking PPO as an example, the training process is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initialize the policy network $\pi_{\theta}(a_t \mid s_t)$ and value network $V_{\phi}(s_t)$ with random weights $\theta$ and $\phi$.
  \item Execute $\tau$ steps in the simulation environment: at each step, choose an action $a_t$ according to the current policy $\pi_{\theta}$, receive the next state $s_{t+1}$ and reward $r_t$, and store the transition $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})$.
  \item Compute the temporal difference target and advantage function:
  \[
    A_t = r_t + \gamma\,V_{\phi}(s_{t+1}) - V_{\phi}(s_t),
  \]
  \[
    G_t = r_t + \gamma\,r_{t+1} + \gamma^2 V_{\phi}(s_{t+2}) + \cdots - V_{\phi}(s_t),
  \]
  where $\gamma \in (0,1)$ is the discount factor.
  \item Update the value network parameters $\phi$ by minimizing the loss:
  \[
    L_{\phi} = \mathbb{E}_t\bigl[\bigl(V_{\phi}(s_t) - G_t \bigr)^2 \bigr].
  \]
  \item Update the policy network parameters $\theta$ by maximizing the clipped probability ratio loss:
  \[
    L_{\theta} = \mathbb{E}_t \Bigl[ \min \bigl( r_t(\theta)\,A_t,\ \mathrm{clip}\bigl(r_t(\theta),\,1-\epsilon,\,1+\epsilon\bigr)\,A_t \bigr) \Bigr],
  \]
  where
  \[
    r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_{\theta}(a_t \mid s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\mathrm{old}}}(a_t \mid s_t)},
  \]
  and $\epsilon$ is the clipping hyperparameter (e.g., 0.2). By alternately updating the policy and value networks, the agent progressively learns to choose actions in the dynamic environment to generate the most challenging scenarios.
\end{enumerate}

After extensive simulation experiments, the PPO agent can learn, after tens of thousands of interaction steps, ``how to approach the most dangerous headway.'' For example, under rainy conditions with reduced friction, it will accelerate at full throttle and suddenly change lanes when the distance to the vehicle in front is 1.2 meters, testing the autonomous system’s emergency braking functionality. As training continues and the threshold gradually decreases to 0.8 meters, the agent still finds more extreme scenarios, forcing the system under test to trigger failure judgments. This process quickly expands boundary coverage, revealing vulnerabilities such as ``minimum safe braking distance'' and ``sensor response delay.''

\paragraph{Experimental Results and Comparison}  
To evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning-driven test exploration, related studies compare the defect detection performance of the following methods in an autonomous driving simulation scenario:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Fixed-Threshold Random Testing (Fixed-Threshold RT)}: Maintain a fixed safety distance threshold $d_{\mathrm{safe}} = 1.5$ meters in all test episodes, and randomly sample environmental disturbances (e.g., random lane changes, random accelerations). This method can only identify some boundary faults but cannot approach more aggressive scenarios.
  \item \textbf{Fixed-Threshold Reinforcement Learning (Fixed-Threshold RL)}: Train the RL agent with a fixed threshold $d_{\mathrm{safe}} = 1.5$ meters in the reward function, allowing the agent to explore extreme scenarios under this threshold. Compared to random testing, it can discover more subtle boundary faults, but being limited by the fixed threshold, it cannot continue exploration if $d_{\mathrm{safe}}$ needs to be further reduced.
  \item \textbf{Dynamic-Threshold Reinforcement Learning (Dynamic-Threshold RL)}: Adopt the aforementioned dynamic threshold design, where the agent iteratively updates the threshold from conservative to aggressive during training to approach the boundary. Experimental results indicate that this method can cover more extreme scenarios with fewer simulation episodes and uncover many boundary points unreachable by random testing and fixed-threshold RL.
\end{itemize}

In balanced simulation comparisons, the dynamic-threshold RL method achieved an 85\% defect detection rate (the proportion of test cases triggering safety failures to all explored cases), while fixed-threshold RL was only 60\%, and fixed-threshold RT only 32\%. This result demonstrates that by introducing dynamic thresholds, the RL agent can explore more extreme boundary conditions while remaining safe, improving test efficiency.

This section has introduced two \textbf{AI-driven test case optimization and boundary exploration} methods: first, \textbf{BCD-based boundary value analysis}; and second, leveraging \textbf{reinforcement learning (RL)} for dynamic environment test exploration. The BCD method defines the mathematical metric $\mathrm{BCD}(T)$ to transform boundary coverage into an optimization objective, and combines MCMC strategies (greedy descent, harmless improvement, probabilistic acceptance) to generate optimal test sets. Experimental results show that BCD-optimized algorithms can significantly improve detection rates for boundary faults---for example, raising the mutation kill rate for the English exam grading program from 36\% to over 80\%. The reinforcement learning approach, aimed at dynamic decision systems such as autonomous driving, emphasizes the agent-system interaction in the simulation environment and employs carefully designed reward functions and dynamic thresholds to iteratively approach failure boundaries. Case studies and simulations demonstrate that dynamic-threshold RL discovers far more extreme scenarios than random testing or fixed-threshold RL, greatly enhancing defect detection.

AI-driven test case optimization enables a paradigm shift from ``manual observation + empirical selection'' to ``quantification + intelligent search,'' offering an effective approach to address testing challenges in contemporary complex software systems. Future work can proceed along the following directions: first, integrate BCD metrics with more diverse boundary representations (e.g., coverage of branch decision paths, data flow coverage) to further improve test quality; second, combine reinforcement learning with symbolic execution, fuzz testing, and other methods to achieve more comprehensive boundary exploration; third, build distributed simulation and parallel optimization platforms for industrial-scale software to enhance the usability and efficiency of AI-driven testing in real-world projects. Through continuous promotion of the deep integration of AI and software testing technologies, software system reliability and safety will be further improved.
\section{AI in Automated Testing Frameworks}

\subsection{Self-Supervised Program Repair (SelfAPR)}

Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a critical technology in software engineering, aiming to reduce the manual effort required for bug localization and fixing during software maintenance. The vision of APR is to automatically generate patches that can correct software defects, thereby accelerating the development cycle and improving software quality.

Early APR approaches primarily relied on search-based methods, such as GenProg \cite{genprog}, which explores the space of possible program modifications using genetic algorithms. Semantics-based techniques, like Angelix \cite{angelix}, leverage symbolic execution to synthesize patches that satisfy certain correctness criteria. While these methods demonstrated promising results, they often struggled with scalability and the ability to generalize across different projects and types of bugs. In recent years, the focus has shifted towards neural machine translation (NMT) models for program repair, which leverage large amounts of code data to learn repair patterns. These neural APR methods, such as DeepRepair \cite{deeprepair} and TBar \cite{tbar}, treat code repair as a translation problem from buggy code to fixed code. However, existing supervised learning frameworks in this domain face two critical limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Lack of Project-Specific Knowledge}: Supervised APR models are typically trained on large, heterogeneous datasets mined from GitHub commits. These datasets often lack the specific programming idioms, domain knowledge, and project-specific patterns present in the target project. For example, the Defects4J benchmark includes bugs like Closure-113, which involves the project-specific token \texttt{requiresLevel.isOn()}. Traditional supervised models fail to repair such bugs because these tokens are not present in their training data \cite{defects4j}.

\item \textbf{Absence of Execution Diagnostics}: Existing neural repair models primarily focus on static code analysis and ignore critical execution signals, such as runtime exceptions and test failure messages. These execution diagnostics provide valuable clues about the nature of the bug, such as whether it is a null pointer exception, an array out-of-bounds error, or a logical error. Ignoring these signals limits the model's ability to generate targeted and effective patches.
\end{enumerate}

To address these challenges, the research proposed \textbf{SelfAPR} (Self-supervised Program Repair with Test Execution Diagnostics)\cite{selfapr_paper}, a novel framework that combines self-supervised learning with test execution diagnostics. SelfAPR introduces two key innovations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Self-Supervised Training via Historical Version Perturbation}: Instead of relying on external datasets, SelfAPR generates training samples by systematically perturbing historical versions of the target project. This approach ensures that the training data is rich in project-specific patterns and idioms, enabling the model to learn how to repair bugs in the context of the target project.

\item \textbf{Multimodal Input Encoding with Execution Diagnostics}: SelfAPR incorporates test execution diagnostics, such as compilation errors, runtime exceptions, and test failure messages, into the input representation of the neural model. This allows the model to leverage both static code information and dynamic execution signals to generate more accurate and targeted patches.
\end{enumerate}

The SelfAPR framework consists of three main components: self-supervised training sample generation, diagnostic encoding, and inference repair. Fig. \ref{fig:APRframework} provides an overview of the framework.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{picture/APRframework.png}
  \caption{Overview of SelfAPR: key novel features are the training sample generator and the diagnostic in the input representation.~\cite{selfapr_paper}.}
  \label{fig:APRframework}
\end{figure}

The first step in SelfAPR is to generate training samples using self-supervised learning. Unlike traditional supervised learning methods that rely on manually labeled data or mined commits, SelfAPR generates training samples by perturbing historical versions of the target project. This approach ensures that the training data is rich in project-specific patterns and idioms.Next, SelfAPR starts by collecting historical versions of the target project from version control systems such as Git. These historical versions represent different states of the project over time, including both buggy and fixed states. By perturbing these historical versions, SelfAPR can generate synthetic training samples that mimic real-world bugs and their repairs.At last, SelfAPR applies a set of syntax tree (AST)-level perturbation rules to the historical versions to generate buggy code samples. These perturbation rules are designed to introduce common types of bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, missing conditions, and incorrect variable assignments. The perturbation model consists of 16 rule categories, each targeting specific syntactic elements in the code. Table \ref{tab:perturbation_rules} lists some of the key perturbation rules used in SelfAPR.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Selected Perturbation Rules in SelfAPR}
\label{tab:perturbation_rules}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
Rule Category & Description \\
\midrule
Rule2 & Modify operators (e.g., replace \texttt{+} with \texttt{-}) \\
Rule5 & Replace variables with other variables in scope \\
Rule6 & Add or remove boolean expressions (e.g., remove a null check) \\
Rule9 & Transplant code blocks from other parts of the program \\
Rule12 & Modify method calls (e.g., change arguments) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For example, Rule6-1 specifically targets the removal of conditions from \texttt{if} statements. This rule can be used to generate training samples that mimic bugs caused by missing null checks or other conditional logic. By applying this rule to a historical version of the Closure project that contains the \texttt{requiresLevel.isOn()} check, SelfAPR can generate a buggy sample where this check is missing, forcing the model to learn how to restore it.

Each perturbed program (\(P'\)) is validated through compilation and testing. If the perturbed program fails compilation or any test cases, it is considered a buggy sample. The original, unperturbed version (\(P\)) is then paired with \(P'\) as the corresponding fixed version. This process results in a large dataset of buggy-fixed code pairs that are specific to the target project. From 17 open-source projects in the Defects4J benchmark, SelfAPR generates 1,039,873 training samples, including 631,015 compilation errors and 408,858 functional errors. These samples cover a wide range of bug types and project-specific patterns, ensuring that the model is exposed to diverse repair scenarios.

The second key component of SelfAPR is the encoding of test execution diagnostics into the input representation of the neural model. Existing neural repair models typically only consider the static code of the buggy program, ignoring valuable dynamic information provided by test execution.

SelfAPR addresses this limitation by incorporating three types of diagnostic information:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Error Type}: This includes whether the error is a compilation error ([CE]) or a functional error ([FE]), along with the specific exception type (e.g., \texttt{NullPointerException}, \texttt{ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException}).

\item \textbf{Error Message}: Detailed error messages from the compiler or test framework, such as ``expected: 1 but was: 0'' or ``variable might not have been initialized.''

\item \textbf{Contextual Information}: This includes the class name, method signature, variable scopes, and surrounding code context where the error occurred.
\end{enumerate}

The diagnostic information is encoded as part of the input sequence to the neural model. For example, for a buggy sample that triggers a null pointer exception, the input sequence would include \texttt{[FE] NullPointerException} followed by the error message and relevant contextual information. This multimodal input allows the model to leverage both static code information and dynamic execution signals to generate more targeted repairs.

During the inference phase, SelfAPR takes a buggy program as input and generates a patch using the trained neural model. The inference process involves several steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Fault Localization}: SelfAPR uses a fault localization tool, such as Gzoltar \cite{gzoltar}, to identify suspicious code lines that are likely to contain the bug. This step helps narrow down the search space for potential repairs.

\item \textbf{Diagnostic Collection}: For each suspicious code line, SelfAPR collects diagnostic information by executing the test suite and capturing any compilation errors or test failures. This information includes the error type, error message, and relevant contextual details.

\item \textbf{Input Preparation}: The suspicious code line, along with its context and the collected diagnostic information, is prepared as input to the neural model. The input is formatted to match the structure used during training, including the diagnostic encoding.

\item \textbf{Patch Generation}: The neural model uses beam search to generate multiple candidate patches. Each candidate patch is a sequence of code modifications that the model believes will fix the bug.

\item \textbf{Validation}: The candidate patches are validated using the test suite. A patch is considered valid if it fixes all failing test cases without introducing new failures. The best valid patch, based on the model's confidence score, is selected as the final repair.
\end{enumerate}

They evaluate SelfAPR on the Defects4J benchmark \cite{defects4j}, which consists of 818 real-world bugs across 17 open-source Java projects. These bugs cover a wide range of bug types, including null pointer exceptions, array out-of-bounds errors, and logical errors. They use both Defects4J v1.2 (388 bugs) and v2.0 (430 bugs) in our experiments.

They compare SelfAPR against 11 state-of-the-art APR methods, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Search-based methods}: GenProg \cite{genprog}, jGenProg \cite{jgenprog}
\item \textbf{Semantics-based methods}: Nopol \cite{nopol}, Angelix \cite{angelix}
\item \textbf{Neural methods}: DeepRepair \cite{deeprepair}, TBar \cite{tbar}, Recoder \cite{recoder}, CURE \cite{cure}
\item \textbf{Self-supervised methods}: BugLab \cite{buglab}, RewardRepair \cite{rewardrepair}
\item \textbf{Hybrid method}: APRGNN \cite{aprgnn}
\end{itemize}

Then they use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the APR methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Correct Patches}: The number of bugs for which the generated patch is semantically correct and passes all test cases.
\item \textbf{Success Rate}: The percentage of bugs that are successfully repaired.
\item \textbf{Precision}: The ratio of correct patches to the total number of generated patches.
\item \textbf{Recall}: The ratio of correct patches to the total number of bugs.
\end{itemize}

Table \ref{tab:comparison} shows the number of bugs repaired by each method on Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0. SelfAPR outperforms all baseline methods, repairing 65 bugs in v1.2 and 45 bugs in v2.0, for a total of 110 bugs. This represents a significant improvement over the best-performing baseline method, Recoder, which repairs 49 bugs in v1.2 and 19 bugs in v2.0. Notably, SelfAPR solves 10 bugs that were not repaired by any previous method, including complex cases such as Closure-57, which requires semantic integration of \texttt{target.getType()} and \texttt{Token.STRING}, and Math-80, which involves a subtle numerical precision issue.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Comparison of Repair Performance on Defects4J}
\label{tab:comparison}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
Method & Defects4J v1.2 & Defects4J v2.0 \\
\midrule
SelfAPR & 65 & 45 \\
Recoder & 49 & 19 \\
CURE & 55 & - \\
RewardRepair & 44 & 43 \\
BugLab & 17 & 6 \\

Nopol & 15 & 11 \\
Angelix & 10 & 8 \\
APRGNN & 38 & 25 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Removing project-specific samples reduces SelfAPR's performance by 30.8\% (from 65 to 45 bugs in v1.2). In particular, the number of bugs repaired in the Closure project drops from 20 to 12, highlighting the importance of project-specific patterns in fixing complex bugs. Without diagnostic information, SelfAPR's performance drops to 56 bugs in v1.2, a reduction of 13.8\%. This decline is particularly pronounced in bugs that require type-specific repairs, such as null pointer exceptions. For example, the Lang-33 bug, which is fixed by adding a null check, cannot be repaired without the \texttt{NullPointerException} diagnostic.

This paper presents SelfAPR, a novel framework for automated program repair that combines self-supervised learning with test execution diagnostics. SelfAPR addresses two critical limitations of existing APR methods: the lack of project-specific knowledge and the absence of execution diagnostics. By generating training samples through systematic perturbation of historical project versions and integrating test execution diagnostics into the repair process, SelfAPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Defects4J benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfAPR outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, fixing 110 bugs in total and solving 10 complex cases that were previously unresolved. Ablation studies confirm the importance of both project-specific training data and test execution diagnostics in achieving these results.

\subsection{AI-Driven CI/CD integration}

\subsubsection*{Introduction}
AI-Driven CI/CD integration represents a transformative shift in software development practices, where artificial intelligence technologies are embedded within continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. This section explores how AI can be effectively integrated with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, as well as with cloud-native platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes, to create intelligent, self-adaptive delivery pipelines.

\subsubsection*{AI in CI/CD}
AI brings significant advancements to the CI/CD process through two primary mechanisms: automated test case generation and intelligent deployment strategies.

\paragraph{Automated Test Case Generation}
AI can generate comprehensive and accurate test cases from natural language requirements, significantly reducing the manual effort required for test script writing. For instance, tools like ScriptEcho and Kimi can analyze requirement documents and automatically produce Pytest test scripts that cover various scenarios, including boundary conditions and equivalence classes.

The process involves:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{NLP Analysis:} AI tools parse requirement documents to extract key functional points.
    \item \textbf{Pattern Recognition:} Based on historical data and machine learning models, AI identifies common testing patterns.
    \item \textbf{Test Case Generation:} AI creates test scripts that are then integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
\end{enumerate}

The generated test cases can be further validated for accuracy using natural language processing techniques to ensure they align with the original requirements.

\paragraph{Intelligent Deployment Strategies}
AI enables the selection of optimal deployment strategies based on real-time analysis of system behavior, historical performance data, and current load conditions. Common strategies include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Blue-Green Deployment
    \item Canary Deployment
    \item A/B Testing
\end{itemize}

AI evaluates factors such as code change complexity, risk level, and system performance to dynamically choose the most appropriate deployment strategy. Additionally, AI can monitor production systems in real-time and trigger automatic rollbacks if performance degrades below predefined thresholds.

\subsubsection{Jenkins Integration with AI}

Jenkins, as a widely used CI/CD tool, can be effectively integrated with AI to create intelligent build and deployment pipelines. This integration follows a **feedback-driven architecture**, where AI models analyze code changes, predict risks, and dynamically adjust testing and deployment strategies.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{picture/jenkins+ai+cursor.pdf}
  \caption{Output of the ADWIN algorithm illustrating abrupt concept drift. When the average error changes significantly, ADWIN shrinks the window and triggers model adjustment. Adapted from Bifet and Gavaldà~\cite{Bifet2007}.}
  \label{fig:adwin}
\end{figure}

The integration workflow includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code Analysis}: AI models (e.g., static analysis, ML-based change impact analysis) identify high-risk code changes.
    \item \textbf{Test Prioritization}: AI generates or prioritizes test cases based on risk scores.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Execution}: Jenkins executes prioritized tests first, reducing feedback loops.
    \item \textbf{Model Feedback}: Test outcomes refine the AI model via continuous learning.
\end{itemize}

This approach reduces redundant testing and accelerates issue detection, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:adwin} for adaptive model updates.

\subsubsection{AI-Driven Deployment Strategies}

AI enhances deployment strategies by introducing **risk-aware decision-making**. Instead of fixed strategies (e.g., blue-green or canary), AI evaluates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Code change complexity
    \item Historical failure rates
    \item System load and resource availability
\end{itemize}

A typical decision flow involves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk Scoring}: AI models assess the risk of deploying new code.
    \item \textbf{Strategy Selection}: High-risk changes trigger conservative strategies (e.g., canary), while low-risk changes allow faster rollouts (e.g., blue-green).
    \item \textbf{Monitoring Feedback}: Post-deployment metrics refine future risk assessments.
\end{itemize}

This creates a **closed-loop system** where deployment decisions adapt to real-time conditions, improving reliability and efficiency.


\subsubsection{Cloud-Native Testing Platforms with High Concurrency Handling}

Cloud-native platforms enable scalable, resilient testing environments by leveraging containerization and orchestration. Key components include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Docker}: Ensures consistent runtime environments for applications and tests.
    \item \textbf{Kubernetes}: Manages container scaling, load balancing, and failover.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)}: Tools like Terraform automate resource provisioning and cost optimization.
\end{itemize}

The architecture for high-concurrency testing typically follows this pattern:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Elastic Scaling}: Kubernetes auto-scales pods based on load (via Horizontal Pod Autoscaler - HPA).
    \item \textbf{Distributed Load Generation}: Tools like Locust simulate user traffic across multiple nodes.
    \item \textbf{Centralized Monitoring}: Metrics and logs are aggregated for performance analysis.
\end{itemize}

This architecture ensures that testing environments can handle peak loads while minimizing idle resource costs.

\subsubsection{Terraform for Resource Management}

Terraform plays a critical role in cloud-native testing by enabling **declarative infrastructure management**. Its principles include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Versioned Templates}: Infrastructure configurations are stored in version control (e.g., Git).
    \item \textbf{Resource Abstraction}: Resources (e.g., VMs, databases) are defined as modular components.
    \item \textbf{Cost Optimization}: Policies enforce resource cleanup after testing cycles.
\end{itemize}

By integrating Terraform with CI/CD pipelines, teams achieve **infrastructure parity** between development, testing, and production environments.

\subsubsection{High Concurrency Testing Practices}

High-concurrency testing validates system behavior under stress. Key principles include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Behavior Modeling}: Define realistic user scenarios (e.g., login, API calls) using tools like Locust.
    \item \textbf{Gradual Load Ramp-Up}: Simulate increasing user traffic to identify breaking points.
    \item \textbf{Resource Utilization Metrics}: Monitor CPU, memory, and latency to detect bottlenecks.
\end{itemize}

The testing pipeline should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pre-deployment Validation}: Ensure systems handle expected load before release.
    \item \textbf{Post-deployment Stress Testing}: Validate resilience in production-like environments.
\end{itemize}

This ensures applications meet performance SLAs while maintaining stability during peak usage.

\subsubsection{Challenges and Solutions}


While AI-driven CI/CD integration offers significant benefits, it also presents several challenges that need to be addressed.

\paragraph{Challenge 1: Accuracy of AI-Generated Test Cases}

AI-generated test cases may not always be accurate or comprehensive, especially if the AI model is not sufficiently trained or if the requirement documents are ambiguous.

\textbf{Solution:} Implement a feedback loop where test results are used to train and improve the AI model. Additionally, use human review for critical test cases to ensure their accuracy.

\paragraph{Challenge 2: Cost Control in Cloud Environments}

Cloud-native testing platforms can quickly consume significant resources, leading to increased costs, particularly when dealing with high-concurrency scenarios.

\textbf{Solution:} Use Terraform to manage resources efficiently and set up cost optimization strategies, such as automatically terminating underutilized resources or scaling down during off-peak hours.

\paragraph{Challenge 3: Security and Compliance}

AI tools may introduce security risks or compliance issues, especially when handling sensitive data or when the AI model itself has vulnerabilities.

\textbf{Solution:} Implement strict security protocols, such as encrypting sensitive data using Kubernetes Secrets, and ensure that AI models are regularly audited and updated to address any security concerns.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

AI-driven CI/CD integration represents a major advancement in software development practices, offering enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. By leveraging AI for automated test case generation and intelligent deployment strategies, organizations can significantly reduce development time and improve software quality.

Cloud-native platforms, including Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, provide the infrastructure necessary to support high-concurrency testing scenarios, ensuring that applications are thoroughly tested before deployment.

While there are challenges associated with AI-driven CI/CD, such as ensuring the accuracy of AI-generated test cases and managing cloud resource costs, these can be addressed through careful planning, implementation of feedback loops, and robust security protocols.

Future developments are likely to see even deeper integration of AI with CI/CD, including the use of quantum computing for more efficient AI models and the expansion of AI-driven practices into new domains, such as financial services and healthcare.

\section{AI for Defect Prediction and Root-Cause Analysis}

Traditional defect prediction systems suffer from 15-40\% accuracy degradation due to concept drift in evolving codebases. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:shap}, black-box model opacity further complicates root-cause analysis, with 34\% higher error rates in unexplained systems.

We address these issues through two innovations: (1) ADWIN-based drift detection enables real-time model adaptation to codebase changes, and (2) hybrid XAI approaches combine LIME's local explanations with SHAP's game-theoretic attributions to achieve 50\% improved fairness in medical diagnostics (Fig. \ref{fig:shap} shows SHAP's superior stability).

\subsection{Machine Learning for Bug Localization}
In the process of software testing and maintenance, rapidly and accurately locating software bugs is a critical task to ensure software quality. Effective bug localization not only reduces the time and cost required for debugging but also minimizes the risk of system failure in production environments. This is particularly crucial in safety-critical domains such as aerospace, healthcare, and finance, where even minor bugs can result in catastrophic outcomes.

Traditional bug localization techniques are mostly based on Information Retrieval (IR) methods. The core idea is to treat a bug report as a query and source code files as documents, then compute textual similarity (e.g., TF-IDF, VSM, BM25) to identify potentially faulty code segments. These methods draw inspiration from search engines and perform relatively well when textual overlap is high. They are simple to implement and computationally efficient, which makes them attractive for large-scale industrial applications. However, they often lack deep modeling of semantics and structural information, limiting their ability to capture context-specific or implicit relationships between the report and code. This limitation becomes more pronounced when codebases grow in size and complexity.

To overcome these challenges, many research efforts have proposed enhancements to IR-based techniques. These include query expansion, term weighting based on semantic relevance, and the use of auxiliary information such as commit messages or version history. While these improvements help to some extent, they still fall short when it comes to deeply understanding the logic and control flow of source code.

With the advancement of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, researchers have introduced DL-based models into bug localization tasks to improve semantic understanding and adaptability. Modern approaches typically rely on representation learning, using pre-trained models such as Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, and CodeBERT to embed bug reports and source code into vector representations. These vectorized representations capture contextual semantics and can be fine-tuned for specific localization tasks, enabling better generalization across different types of bugs.

For source code, structural features such as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), Control Flow Graphs (CFGs), and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs) are incorporated and processed by models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or Transformer-based encoders. Such models allow for hierarchical and syntactic relationships to be learned automatically from raw code. Additionally, large-scale pretraining on code corpora such as GitHub enhances the model’s ability to deal with real-world coding styles and idioms.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{picture/5.1fig1.pdf}
  \caption{Architecture of a machine learning-based bug localization framework. The system collects predicate information during execution and learns cause-effect chains using statistical models. Adapted from Jiang and Su~\cite{Li2024}.}
  \label{fig:framework}
\end{figure}

Some systems adopt hybrid approaches that combine the interpretability of IR models with the nonlinear modeling capabilities of DL techniques, achieving a balance between performance and generalization ability~\cite{Li2024}. These hybrid models may use IR scores as features or priors in neural ranking functions, or apply ensemble techniques to merge predictions from multiple subsystems. Empirical studies have shown that these combined models outperform standalone IR or DL methods on many benchmark datasets.

However, in real-world software systems, the performance of bug localization models is not static. Particularly in Continuous Integration (CI) or Continuous Deployment (CD) environments, model performance may degrade over time due to code changes, version updates, and data distribution shifts---this phenomenon is known as concept drift. Codebases evolve rapidly, introducing new APIs, renaming identifiers, or refactoring modules, all of which may invalidate the learned patterns in the model. Such drift is not always immediately visible in accuracy metrics, making it challenging to detect without specialized mechanisms.

To address this challenge, online drift detection mechanisms have become an essential part of modern testing systems. These mechanisms continuously monitor prediction outcomes and model confidence over time, triggering adaptive behaviors such as retraining, threshold recalibration, or fallback strategies. Drift detection is especially important in large-scale collaborative projects, where contributors may follow inconsistent naming conventions or coding standards, increasing the likelihood of semantic shifts.

ADWIN (Adaptive Windowing) is a performance-aware concept drift detection algorithm designed for streaming data environments. Its core idea is to maintain a sliding window and dynamically split it into two sub-windows \( W_0 \) and \( W_1 \), then compare their means. If the difference in means exceeds a threshold \( \epsilon \) derived from Hoeffding’s inequality, a concept drift is detected:
%formula 
\[
\left| \mu_{W_0} - \mu_{W_1} \right| > \epsilon = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{2m} \ln \left( \frac{4}{\delta} \right) }
\]
Here, \( \mu \) denotes the mean of the window, \( m \) is the number of effective samples, and \( \delta \) is the confidence parameter~\cite{Bifet2007}.
This formulation ensures that the detection is statistically sound, providing probabilistic guarantees that can be tuned according to the desired sensitivity level.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{picture/5.1fig2.pdf}
  \caption{Output of the ADWIN algorithm illustrating abrupt concept drift. When the average error changes significantly, ADWIN shrinks the window and triggers model adjustment. Adapted from Bifet and Gavaldà~\cite{Bifet2007}.}
  \label{fig:adwin}
\end{figure}

Applying ADWIN (Adaptive Windowing) to the continuous testing of bug localization systems enables a range of tangible benefits, especially in environments characterized by frequent code changes and evolving data distributions. Concept drift---whether gradual or abrupt---can severely impact the reliability of machine learning-based localization models. These drifts are often introduced by new programming paradigms, third-party library updates, or changes in software development patterns (e.g., shifting from object-oriented to functional styles). Integrating ADWIN into the model monitoring pipeline allows development teams to detect and respond proactively to such changes before they manifest as critical failures.

(1) Real-time performance monitoring.
Key evaluation metrics such as Top-K accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) can be continuously tracked in streaming or batch-incremental settings. ADWIN leverages a statistically grounded approach by maintaining a dynamic sliding window over performance logs or prediction results. When a significant change in the mean performance of the recent window (\( \mu\)\( W_1 \) ) versus the historical window (\( \mu\)\( W_0 \))is detected beyond the Hoeffding inequality-based threshold, the system flags the event as drift. In such cases, the system can automatically trigger retraining procedures with recent test feedback or even initiate emergency rollback to previously validated model states. This approach ensures early identification and mitigation of performance deterioration before it affects mission-critical tasks such as automated triage or root cause suggestion.

(2) Dynamic test strategy adjustment.
In drift-aware testing frameworks, testing strategies are no longer static. ADWIN's output can guide the reallocation of test resources in real time. For example, the sampling rate for test inputs may be dynamically increased for modules exhibiting volatile behavior. Feature engineering steps, such as AST traversal or embedding updates (e.g., from CodeBERT), may be refreshed at higher frequencies when drift is suspected. Moreover, adaptive thresholding and test prioritization policies can be employed---ranking predictions not only by confidence scores but also by drift-adjusted uncertainty. Such mechanisms are crucial in continuous learning scenarios, where traditional static validation sets fail to capture real-world evolution.

(3) Support for adaptive testing platforms in CI/CD environments.
Modern DevOps workflows are heavily reliant on Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) infrastructure, often with hundreds or thousands of changes per day. In these environments, ADWIN can be deployed as a lightweight watchdog module within the testing pipeline. When integrated with Git hooks, container orchestration systems (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), or distributed logging frameworks (e.g., ELK Stack), it enables near-real-time identification of modules that show signs of behavioral instability. Drift-aware tagging allows test schedulers to assign more computing resources to unstable components while deprioritizing modules exhibiting consistent historical performance. Empirical case studies from open-source ecosystems such as Eclipse, Mozilla, and Apache Spark show that ADWIN-equipped systems reduce deployment rollbacks by over 20\% and exhibit faster mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) during regression handling.

Beyond these technical advantages, the broader significance of ADWIN lies in its support for adaptive and intelligent quality assurance. Drift detection is not merely an auxiliary mechanism---it becomes a feedback engine that closes the loop between test results, model diagnosis, and model improvement. This enables a transition from brittle, pre-defined test scripts to agile, self-aware systems that can adjust their validation logic based on live system conditions.

As AI becomes deeply embedded in enterprise software---from cloud orchestration to developer assistants---the importance of transparency and traceability across versions escalates. ADWIN facilitates this by not only signaling anomalies but also explaining when, where, and why the model behavior shifted. This allows for better root cause analysis and reduces the debugging burden on engineers. Furthermore, it opens doors for human-in-the-loop testing workflows, where expert testers are alerted only when statistically significant deviations are detected, improving both test productivity and decision confidence.

In summary, tools like ADWIN are not just statistical drift detectors---they are pillars of a new era of resilient, explainable, and trustworthy AI-powered testing systems. Their integration into the continuous testing lifecycle empowers organizations to build software that learns, adapts, and evolves alongside the environments in which it operates.

\subsection{Explainable AI (XAI) in Test Debugging}
With the widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in critical domains such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and finance, the reliability, transparency, and safety of AI systems have received increasing attention. In high-stakes decision-making environments, a single incorrect or unexplained output from an AI model can have severe consequences, ranging from financial losses to threats to human life. Therefore, ensuring that AI systems are not only performant but also interpretable has become a vital requirement in both academic research and industrial deployment.

During the stages of system testing and debugging, traditional black-box models often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. These models can produce accurate predictions, but without providing any insight into how those predictions are made. This opaqueness makes it difficult for testers and developers to trace the logic behind model outputs, understand unexpected behavior, or validate system reliability. As a result, the lack of interpretability restricts the efficiency of error localization, fault analysis, and iterative model improvement. In sensitive areas such as healthcare, where trust and accountability are critical, this lack of clarity may even pose direct threats to user safety and regulatory compliance.

To address these challenges, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a complementary approach that aims to make AI systems more transparent and understandable. In particular, integrating XAI methods into AI system testing has become a key approach to improving testing effectiveness, identifying hidden failure modes, and enhancing user trust. XAI tools enable practitioners to uncover which features influenced a prediction, assess whether the model’s logic aligns with human expectations, and flag unintended biases embedded in the model.

Two commonly used post-hoc XAI tools are LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations). These model-agnostic explanation methods allow testers to understand the prediction logic without altering the original model architecture or retraining. They are widely applicable across domains and have proven useful in highlighting potential flaws related to feature dependencies, data distribution shifts, and hidden biases. For instance, both methods have been successfully used in model audits, healthcare diagnostics, and algorithmic fairness analysis.

The core idea of LIME is to generate local perturbations around a specific prediction instance and fit a linear surrogate model that approximates the local decision boundary of the complex model. This localized linear model is interpretable and helps to reveal the relative contribution---either positive or negative---of each input feature to the prediction result. In practical testing and debugging scenarios, LIME is frequently employed to check whether a model is relying on irrelevant or spurious features. For example, in the testing of an autonomous driving system, a model erroneously classified a stop sign as something else. Using LIME for explanation revealed that the model was relying not on the features of the stop sign itself, but rather on the color of a building in the background. This insight enabled testers to identify an unintended sensitivity to environmental context. As a corrective measure, the data augmentation strategy was improved, and the feature engineering process was revised to reduce background dependency. Ultimately, this enhanced the model’s robustness and generalization in real-world, variable environments~\cite{Ribeiro2016}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{picture/5.2fig1.pdf}
  \caption{LIME explanation example. The red cross marks the instance being explained. The background colors represent the black-box model’s decision surface, and the dashed line shows the linear surrogate model used for local interpretation~\cite{Ribeiro2016}.}
  \label{fig:lime}
\end{figure}

Unlike the local linear explanations offered by LIME, SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) is grounded in cooperative game theory. It leverages the Shapley value concept, which defines a unique and fair distribution of contribution among players in a game. In the context of machine learning, each input feature is treated as a ``player,'' and SHAP calculates its marginal contribution by considering all possible subsets of features. This results in feature attributions that are not only consistent across different model architectures but also satisfy desirable mathematical properties such as local accuracy, missingness, and additivity.

By aggregating over all possible permutations of features, SHAP provides a globally faithful representation of how each feature influences the model’s output. This global and theoretically principled framework makes SHAP particularly useful for high-stakes domains where interpretability must align with regulatory and ethical standards. Moreover, SHAP explanations are model-agnostic and can be applied to both tree-based models (using TreeSHAP) and deep learning models (using DeepSHAP or GradientSHAP).

SHAP has shown remarkable value in the testing of medical AI systems, where fairness and accountability are critical. For instance, during the testing of a dermatology diagnosis model, researchers discovered that the model’s misdiagnosis rate for patients with darker skin tones was significantly higher than for other groups. This raised concerns about potential racial or demographic bias in the AI system. Using SHAP to analyze individual predictions, researchers found that the model assigned disproportionately low importance to pixel regions corresponding to skin tone for darker-skinned individuals.

This under-weighting indicated that the model was effectively ignoring relevant visual cues in these populations. Upon further investigation, it was confirmed that the original training dataset contained a disproportionately small number of samples from minority groups. As a remediation step, researchers rebalanced the training data through targeted data collection and synthetic augmentation, followed by model retraining. This intervention not only improved the model’s classification accuracy across demographic subgroups but also significantly enhanced its fairness and generalization capability.

More importantly, this process led to a notable improvement in user trust. Clinicians and patients expressed greater confidence in the AI-assisted diagnostic system, knowing that its decision-making process had been thoroughly analyzed, its biases revealed and mitigated, and its output explanations made transparent and accessible. This case illustrates how SHAP can serve as a powerful debugging tool in model validation pipelines, particularly in domains where human trust, regulatory scrutiny, and ethical transparency are indispensable~\cite{Lundberg2017}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{picture/5.2fig2.pdf}
  \caption{Comparison of SHAP, Shapley sampling, and LIME. SHAP provides more stable and accurate feature importance estimates relative to the true Shapley value~\cite{Lundberg2017}.}
  \label{fig:shap}
\end{figure}

Beyond the application of single explainability tools such as LIME and SHAP, recent advances in the field of Explainable AI (XAI) have emphasized the value of hybrid strategies that integrate the strengths of both interpretable and black-box models. These hybrid approaches aim to bridge the gap between model transparency and predictive accuracy---two attributes that are often at odds in practical systems. By leveraging a combination of inherently interpretable models (such as decision trees, rule-based classifiers, or linear models) and high-performance but opaque models (such as deep neural networks), these strategies offer greater flexibility and adaptability in real-world testing scenarios.

One effective method in this domain involves training a surrogate model to approximate the behavior of a black-box model within a localized region of the input space. For instance, in image classification tasks, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may be employed for high-accuracy predictions. Meanwhile, a shallow decision tree or locally linear model is trained using samples near the prediction boundary to approximate the decision process. This allows developers to trace how changes in input features affect the model's classification output and identify unexpected decision boundaries that may indicate spurious correlations or overfitting.

Such hybrid XAI systems have also proven beneficial for behavior monitoring and anomaly detection in testing environments. For example, when combined with drift detection mechanisms, these interpretable surrogate models can provide human-understandable alerts about changing model behavior over time. This makes them particularly suitable for real-time applications such as fraud detection, autonomous driving, and industrial quality control, where continuous monitoring and rapid debugging are critical. Importantly, these approaches allow for the benefits of deep learning to be retained while offering windows of transparency to facilitate error analysis and human-in-the-loop evaluation.

The objectives of XAI extend well beyond providing technical explanations for individual predictions. A core mission of XAI is to foster and maintain user trust---an essential factor for the deployment and acceptance of AI technologies in critical applications. In this context, explanations serve as mechanisms of accountability and validation, enabling users to assess whether model decisions are aligned with domain knowledge, ethical standards, and legal regulations.

In addition to building trust, XAI plays a key role in uncovering causal relationships that may not be directly evident from model outputs. This is particularly important when testing AI systems that are deployed in dynamic and sensitive environments. For instance, an AI-based decision support system in a hospital must not only provide accurate recommendations but also clarify which medical factors contributed most significantly to the decision, especially when the stakes involve life-altering treatment plans.

XAI also contributes to privacy awareness by exposing which input attributes have the greatest influence on model outcomes. In privacy-sensitive domains, this visibility enables developers to assess whether models are unintentionally leveraging sensitive or protected attributes, such as gender, race, or age, even if such features are not explicitly included in the input. Thus, XAI tools support auditing and bias mitigation efforts during the testing phase, helping organizations align with fairness and data protection policies.

Looking ahead, the role of XAI in AI testing is expected to evolve from passive interpretation to active guidance. Emerging research explores causal explainability, where models attempt to uncover not just correlations but underlying causal mechanisms that drive predictions. Interactive explanation interfaces are also being developed, allowing developers and domain experts to ask ``what-if'' and ``why-not'' questions during testing and debugging. These tools enable iterative, dialogue-based model refinement that closely resembles the scientific method.

Furthermore, task-specific interpretability metrics are gaining traction as a means to quantify the usefulness and clarity of explanations in different contexts. For example, interpretability requirements in legal AI may differ vastly from those in autonomous robotics. By tailoring XAI tools to match the cognitive and operational needs of end-users, researchers aim to create more accessible, accountable, and adaptive testing environments. In this future paradigm, XAI will not merely be a diagnostic tool, but a central component of the AI development lifecycle---one that shapes model architecture, training, validation, and deployment in a feedback-rich, human-aligned manner.

Two systemic risks threaten AI testing adoption: (1) 38.7\% performance drops in unseen domains, and (2) 45\% false positive rates in biased systems like COMPAS. These challenges create a ``validation scalability crisis'' where traditional methods fail to meet safety requirements for critical systems.

We analyze mitigation strategies across three dimensions: domain generalization techniques (Table \ref{tab:mitigation}) address data dependency, while Ethical Oracle frameworks formalize bias detection through fairness metrics. Technical solutions include adversarial validation and safety channels with Mahalanobis distance thresholding.

\subsection{Over-Reliance on Training Data}

\subsubsection{Systemic Risks from Data Dependencies}

The validation of AI systems faces fundamental challenges due to their inherent dependence on training data. This dependency creates systemic risks manifested in two primary dimensions: \textit{static data bias} and \textit{dynamic concept drift}. The Microsoft Tay chatbot incident (2016) exemplifies catastrophic failure caused by data dependency. Designed as an interactive learning agent, Tay rapidly adopted offensive language patterns after exposure to malicious user inputs, demonstrating how training data directly dictates system behavior. This case underscores a critical vulnerability: AI systems inherently amplify biases and anomalies present in their training data .

Additional case studies highlight similar risks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Facial Recognition Bias}: Studies show commercial systems exhibit 34\% higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals compared to lighter-skinned subjects .
    \item \textbf{Healthcare Diagnostics}: An AI diagnostic tool trained on predominantly white skin lesion datasets showed 50\% reduced accuracy when applied to darker skin tones .
    \item \textbf{Recidivism Prediction}: ProPublica's analysis revealed COMPAS algorithm disproportionately flagged Black defendants as high-risk with 45\% false positive rate vs 23\% for white defendants .
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Impact on Validation Effectiveness}

Data dependency fundamentally compromises traditional validation approaches in three key ways:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Generalization Fallacy}: Validation methods like k-fold cross-validation measure performance on \textit{known} data distributions but fail to guarantee robustness in novel environments. As demonstrated , 78\% of ML validation studies exclusively use static dataset partitioning, creating false confidence in generalization capability. Recent work shows that models often exploit spurious correlations in training data that break under distribution shifts.
    
    \item \textbf{Concept Drift Vulnerability}: The literature review identifies concept drift as a primary validation challenge. When real-world data distributions shift post-deployment (e.g., COVID-19 disrupting consumer behavior patterns), models degrade silently without continuous monitoring. Industrial case studies show accuracy drops of 15-40\% within 6 months of deployment . Financial fraud detection systems experienced 32\% performance degradation during market crashes due to distribution shifts in transaction patterns .
    
    \item \textbf{Validation Scalability Crisis}: For safety-critical systems like autonomous vehicles, Kalra \& Paddock  prove that traditional trial-based validation requires 275 million test miles to statistically demonstrate reliability - an infeasible requirement highlighting the insufficiency of data-dependent validation paradigms. In aviation safety, equivalent validation would require 25 billion flight hours to achieve 99.999\% reliability .
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mitigation Strategies}
The literature review synthesizes emerging solutions to address data dependency:

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Data Dependency Mitigation Approaches}
\label{tab:mitigation}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.25\textwidth}p{0.6\textwidth}}
\hline
\textbf{Technique} & \textbf{Implementation Framework} \\
\hline
Domain Generalization & \begin{itemize}
    \item Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM): Learn features invariant across environments using $\min_{\theta}\mathbb{E}_{e}[R_{e}(h_{\theta})]$
    \item Adversarial Data Augmentation: Generate critical edge cases (e.g., rare road conditions) using GANs or diffusion models
    \item Meta-Learning: Optimize for fast adaptation to new domains via MAML framework
\end{itemize} \\
\hline
Continuous Validation & \begin{itemize}
    \item Failure Monitors: Real-time performance tracking with statistical process control (SPC) charts
    \item Safety Channels: Fallback mechanisms when data drift exceeds thresholds (e.g., human-in-the-loop)
    \item Input Restrictions: Constrain system operation to validated data domains using geofencing or feature bounding
\end{itemize} \\
\hline
Hybrid Validation & \begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation-Trial Integration: Use simulated edge cases to augment real-world trials (e.g., CARLA for autonomous vehicles)
    \item Ensemble Validation: Combine model-centered tests with system-level trials using Bayesian model averaging
\end{itemize} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The most effective approaches combine \textit{proactive data curation} with \textit{runtime monitoring}. Domain generalization techniques expand the validation coverage during development, while continuous validation mechanisms (identified in 14\% of reviewed studies) provide operational safeguards. As demonstrated in autonomous vehicle systems, combining adversarial simulation with input restrictions reduces critical failures by 63\% compared to standalone model validation .

\textbf{Implementation Guidelines}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Establish data validation pipelines with explicit \textit{representativeness metrics} (e.g., demographic parity, feature coverage entropy)
    \item Implement concept drift detection using statistical process control charts with exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control limits
    \item Design fallback mechanisms (safety channels) for out-of-distribution inputs using Mahalanobis distance thresholding
    \item Allocate ≥30\% of validation budget to synthetic edge case generation (e.g., using SMOTE variants for imbalanced data)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Emerging Research Directions}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Completeness Paradox}: Developing mathematical frameworks to quantify the tradeoff between training diversity and validation feasibility
    \item \textbf{Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer}: Leveraging pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, DALL-E) to bridge domain gaps in validation data
    \item \textbf{Adversarial Validation}: Using game-theoretic approaches to identify worst-case distribution shifts
    \item \textbf{Human-AI Collaboration}: Integrating cognitive science principles to design hybrid validation protocols that leverage human pattern recognition capabilities
\end{itemize}

Future research must address the ``data completeness paradox''---the tension between expanding training data diversity and maintaining validation feasibility. Cross-disciplinary collaborations with domain experts show promise for creating targeted validation datasets that capture critical real-world variations without exponential cost growth. As illustrated in medical imaging validation, partnerships between radiologists and ML engineers produced 40\% more representative datasets for rare pathologies compared to purely algorithmic approaches .

\subsection{Ethical and Legal Risks in AI Testing}

\textit{This subsection is contributed by Zheng Li.}

The ethical and legal risks in AI-assisted testing arise from the inherent biases in training data and the opacity of decision-making processes. As seen in the Microsoft Tay chatbot case, generative models trained on unfiltered user inputs can propagate harmful patterns, raising critical concerns about accountability and harm mitigation. This aligns with the broader challenge of ensuring fairness, transparency, and privacy in AI systems, as outlined in the Responsible AI principles\cite{Zhou2024}. For instance, in facial recognition testing, biased synthetic data generation has led to 34\% higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals, violating the principle of demographic parity. Similarly, autonomous vehicle testing with underrepresented edge cases (e.g., nighttime driving) risks deploying systems with latent safety flaws, creating potential legal liabilities under product safety regulations.

To address these risks, we propose an \textbf{Ethical Oracle framework} that formalizes bias detection and mitigation during test data generation. This framework incorporates fairness metrics like disparate impact and equalized odds into the validation pipeline, ensuring synthetic datasets adhere to legal standards such as the EU AI Act and GDPR. For example, in healthcare diagnostics, the framework would flag underrepresented patient demographics in training data, triggering synthetic augmentation to balance coverage. Additionally, privacy-preserving generative models (e.g., differentially private GANs) are essential to prevent sensitive data leakage in test environments.

A critical case study is the COMPAS recidivism algorithm, where biased test datasets perpetuated racial disparities in risk scores, leading to litigation and regulatory scrutiny. This highlights the need for test case provenance tracking, where every synthetic input’s origin and transformation history are logged for auditability. By integrating these ethical and legal safeguards, AI testing transitions from a purely technical tool to a socially responsible practice, aligning with emerging standards like ISO/IEC 24029-1 for AI trustworthiness.

\section{Future Directions and Conclusion}

\textit{This section is contributed by Zheng Li.}

Current AI testing frameworks face limitations in adapting to agile development cycles and evolving technical standards. Despite SelfAPR's 110 bug repairs, its reliance on 10,000 training iterations creates deployment latency. Meanwhile, 99.999\% reliability requirements for aviation systems highlight scalability gaps in existing approaches.

We propose two transformative directions: (1) LLM-driven testing that leverages chain-of-thought reasoning for synthetic edge case generation, and (2) DevOps-native AI integration through streaming validation and infrastructure-as-code principles. Section \ref{subsec:7.1} details how GPT-4 can automate test scenario construction, while Section \ref{subsec:7.2} shows Kubernetes-managed adaptive testing pipelines.

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{subsec:7.1}

The integration of large language models (LLMs) into test automation represents a paradigm shift in handling high-dimensional and context-sensitive software systems. Unlike traditional methods constrained by predefined grammar or rule-based templates, LLMs like GPT-4 leverage their vast pretraining on code repositories to generate test cases that adapt to evolving project structures. For example, in the SelfAPR framework, LLMs could refine perturbation rules by learning project-specific idioms from Git commit histories, reducing the manual effort required for rule design.

A key innovation lies in prompt engineering for test generation, where natural language requirements are translated into structured test scenarios. Consider an autonomous driving system: an LLM could parse a requirement like ``detect pedestrians in low-light conditions'' and generate synthetic test inputs spanning rare edge cases (e.g., reflective clothing under foggy headlights). This capability is further enhanced by chain-of-thought reasoning, where the model iteratively constructs test sequences by simulating cause-effect relationships in the system under test.

Additionally, multi-agent LLM systems offer promise for adversarial testing. By simulating both a ``tester'' and ``developer'' agent in a game-theoretic framework\cite{Li2018}, LLMs can dynamically identify vulnerabilities through competitive interaction. For instance, in financial fraud detection, one agent might generate synthetic transaction patterns to uncover logical errors in the fraud classifier, while another agent refines the model’s decision boundaries. This self-improving loop mirrors the BCD optimization paradigm but operates at the semantic level, enabling coverage of abstract failure modes beyond traditional boundary analysis.

\subsection{Future Directions}
\label{subsec:7.2}

AI-driven testing frameworks must align with Agile and DevOps workflows to deliver real-time feedback in continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Traditional testing models, which require manual retraining and static validation, are incompatible with the rapid iteration cycles of DevOps. Instead, we advocate for self-adaptive testing systems that dynamically adjust to codebase changes using streaming learning and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles.

For example, Jenkins pipelines enhanced with AI can prioritize test execution based on risk scores derived from Git commit metadata. High-risk changes (e.g., modifications to critical modules) trigger BCD-optimized boundary testing, while low-risk updates use lightweight LLM-generated smoke tests. This approach reduces feedback latency by 40\% in microservices architectures, as demonstrated in cloud-native platforms like Kubernetes, where Docker containers ensure consistent runtime environments for test execution.

A transformative application is AI-driven canary deployments, where reinforcement learning agents monitor real-time system metrics and dynamically adjust rollout thresholds. In a Kubernetes cluster, the agent might detect increased latency in a new API service and automatically roll back to a validated version, preventing production outages. This closed-loop system is further strengthened by Terraform-managed infrastructure, which enforces cost optimization and resource cleanup post-testing.

Looking ahead, AI-powered DevOps will require human-AI collaboration to balance automation with expert judgment. For instance, while an LLM might generate 80\% of test scripts for a sprint, domain experts focus on validating edge cases in high-stakes modules (e.g., payment gateways). This hybrid model ensures agility without sacrificing safety, embodying the shift from ``manual observation + empirical selection'' to ``quantification + intelligent search''.
